Problem Statement: Customer Segmentation and analysis for a retail company.

Understanding consumer behavior helps businesses better sell products and
provide services. Market researchers often use consumer segmentation as a
tool to analyze various groups of consumers. A segment is a group of customers
(present or potential) with similar characteristics. Marketers then use those
characteristics to create a target market for their product or service. Once a
firm has effectively “segmented” the market, it must choose to “target” one or
more closely related segments in which it can focus its marketing efforts on.

Integrated marketing agencies usually prioritize segments based on a
combination of factors including sales, loyalty, profitability, as well as other
strategic considerations. Without the ability to track and analyze your decisions
as well as your customers’ purchases and behaviors, your business risks falling
behind.
